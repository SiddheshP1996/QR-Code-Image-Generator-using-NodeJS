# QR-Code-Image-Generator-using-NodeJS

<strong>I have attempted to create a qr-code-image-generator using NodeJS JavaScript Runtime Environment.</strong>

To install the libraries using <strong>NodeJS Runtime Environment</strong> use the below command in the terminal to get the libraries installed and ready to use.
<li><strong> npm i inquirer qr-image</strong></li>



The location to install the library may vary as per your requirement it can be installed using <strong>-g</strong> flag i.e. globally throughout your device 
or restricted to your folder just using <strong>npm i</strong> and the libraries in the specified folder location. 

<ol>
  <li>Installed <strong>inquirer</strong> and <strong>qr-image</strong> npm packages to generate the qr-code image.</li>
  <li>Imported <strong>inquirer object</strong> from inquirer package and <strong>qr object</strong> from qr-image package.</li>
  <li>You need to provide a <strong>url as input link</strong> for which you need to generate the qr-image</li>
  <li>It will create a <strong>qr-code-image</strong> for your provided url input link.</li>
  <li>It will generate qr-code image in the <strong>.png</strong> foormat/extension by default.</li>
</ol>
